Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) used for tracking changes in source code during software development.
It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, coordinating their work and ensuring that
changes are properly managed and documented.

Here are some key concepts and features of Git:

Version Control: Git tracks changes made to files in a project over time.
It records who made the changes, when they were made, and what the changes were.
This enables developers to revert to previous versions of files if needed,
compare changes between versions, and collaborate effectively.

Distributed: Git is a distributed version control system,
meaning that each developer has a complete copy of the entire repository,
including its full history. This allows developers to work offline and independently,
making it more resilient to network failures and facilitating decentralized collaboration.

Branching: Git uses branches to create parallel lines of development within a repository. 
Each branch represents a separate line of work, allowing developers to 
experiment with new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. 
Branches can be merged back together when the work is complete.

Merging: Git provides tools for combining changes from one branch into another. 
This process, known as merging, allows developers to integrate their work with changes made by others. 
Git automatically handles merging in many cases, 
but conflicts may arise when changes overlap, requiring manual resolution.

Remote Repositories: Git allows repositories to be hosted on remote servers, 
such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Developers can push changes 
from their local repository to a remote repository and pull changes 
from a remote repository to their local repository, enabling collaboration with team members.

Committing: In Git, changes to files are grouped into commits. 
A commit represents a single, atomic change to the repository and includes a message 
describing the change. Commits are stored chronologically, 
forming a timeline of the project's development history.

Tagging: Git allows developers to create tags to mark specific points 
in the repository's history, such as releases or significant milestones. 
Tags provide a way to reference and retrieve specific versions of the codebase easily.
